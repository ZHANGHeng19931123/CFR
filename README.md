## Introduction

Multispectral images (e.g. visible and infrared) may be particularly useful when detecting objects with the same model in different environments (e.g. day/night outdoor scenes). To effectively use the different spectra, the main technical problem resides in the information fusion process. In this paper, we propose a new halfway feature fusion method for neural networks that leverages the complementary/consistency balance existing in multispectral features by adding to the network architecture, a particular module that cyclically fuses and refines each spectral feature. We evaluate the effectiveness of our fusion method on two challenging multispectral datasets for object detection. Our results show that implementing our Cyclic Fuse-and-Refine module in any network improves the performance on both datasets compared to other state-of-the-art multispectral object detection methods.

## Results

In this repository we provide the detection results of CFR model for [KAIST dataset](https://soonminhwang.github.io/rgbt-ped-detection/).

Note that the result reported in the paper was the averaged performance after repeating the experiments for ten times. The provided result belongs to one of the ten models. It is very close but slightly better than the averaged performance reported in the paper.
